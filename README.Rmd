## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

* `{pprules}` is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package with functions
that help generate custom [piecepack](http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/HomePage) rulesets and books.
* `save_ruleset()` supports saving rulesets in a variety of file formats via `pandoc`
  while `save_pamphlet()` supports saving rulesets in a compact tri-fold pamphlet format.
* `save_rulebook()` supports saving a rulebook.  Currently only supports "The Historical Piecepacker".
* This is an extraction and refinement of functionality originally contained in the experimental [{ppgames}](https://www.github.com/piecepackr/ppgames) package.

## <a name="installation">Installation</a>

To install the `{pprules}` R package use the following commands in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/):

``` {.r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("piecepackr/pprules")
```

If you want to make rulebooks you\'ll need `xelatex` and if you want to
make rulesets you\'ll need a recent version of `pandoc`. The following
instructions should work on Ubuntu:

``` {.bash}
sudo apt install texlive-xetex
sudo apt install cabal-install
cabal update # add $HOME/.cabal/bin to $PATH
cabal install pandoc
```

## <a name="examples">Examples</a>

```r
library("pprules")
gk <- game_kit()
save_pamphlet("tablut", gk=gk)
save_ruleset("nine-mens-morris", gk=gk)
save_rulebook("the-historical-piecepacker", gk=gk)
```
